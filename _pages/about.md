<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Recently, my work has been centered on pioneering technical innovations in the structured reasoning of large language models (LLMs), guided by managerial theories, to advance AIâ€™s capabilities in intelligent perception, cognition, and reasoning of multimodal user behaviors. My research has consistently focused on developing theory-driven, interpretable deep learning models tailored for industrial applications and business value creation, adhering to the computational design science paradigm within Information Systems.

Please refer to my CV for more details about me.
